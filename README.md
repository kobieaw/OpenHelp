# OpenHelp
A repository for OpenHelp which aims to create open information for helping less fortunate people

Problem: 
  1) People homeless on the street/Need help
  2) Some people who are not in the bad situation want to help but they can't TRUST that finances sent will be used for things that will be positive for the receiving person 
  3) Trust uncertainty creates a bottleneck from the money that goes out to people in need vs how much people would be willing to give if there was trust. 

Constraints: 
  1) To not contribute to the negative parts of the welfare state (People taking money and resources but not contributing back to society) 
  2) Technology for people to receive funds? 
  3) User Experience for both parties?
